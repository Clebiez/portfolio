    "how_work_4": "To record these metrics, we run the scenario in a <strong>Docker container</strong>, it will serve as a black box to isolate the browser processes from the rest of the machine. The <strong>Docker Engine API</strong> allows us to harvest metrics from this container. Once the scenario is complete, data are sent to an API that which converts it and creates a result page.",
    "how_work_5": "In addition, it is also possible to monitor other containers than the browser one, such as an API, a database, a Redit by listening them while the browser interacts with the web app.",

During its development we were charge to design the UI of the application developped with <strong>NextJS</strong> for the front-end and <strong>NodeJS</strong> for the CLI and the API. The project is deployed on an AWS and the infrastructure is code-driven with Terraform.",
    "from_design_2": "Obviously, we take into account best practices of eco-design and digital sobriety in order to have a lightweight and resource-efficient application. By the way, <strong>GreenFrame est monitoré avec GreenFrame dans sa CI</strong> !",
    "from_design_3": "I learned a lot here and it was a challenging project. Especially by achieving a feature in the shortest possible time without compromising the quality of the application."
