                <h2>Software creativity: Create your startup</h2>
                <p>
                    Software creativity is a particular course because we
                    operate accross 2 different classes, generally with students
                    in Computing Science Master and Marketting Master.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, participants mix in teams and find an idea of a
                    startup project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During 2 months, they will works on their idea from a
                    solution to solve to a functional prototype with a business
                    model. They also have to quantify the public interest by
                    sharing surveys on social network or maybe going into the
                    city center by interviewing people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On my side, I work with students to{' '}
                    <strong>
                        teach them the notion of a Minimal Viable product
                    </strong>
                    , how to determine which feature we have to include in it
                    and <strong>how to construct it faster as possible</strong>.
                    I help them to find the best way to develop a working
                    prototype very quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Generally, to be faster, we use no code tools like{' '}
                    <a href="https://www.adalo.com/">Adalo</a> or{' '}
                    <a href="https://bubble.io/">Bubble</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end, we organize a fake crowdfunding public event
                    where participants will pitch their final product to
                    investissors and show a demo of their prototypes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also recruit fake business angel, they have 25K â‚¬ to
                    spent on one or multiple projects, and the final amount
                    recolted will be a part of the final grade.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Some of our students have decided after this course to
                        continue with their start-up project in the real life.
